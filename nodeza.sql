It was one of the most informative and comprehensive meetups that I have ever attended.\r\n\r\nEvan Summers  is a Software Engineer at [IOLMobile.co.za](http://iolmobile.co.za), one of the most popular news websites in South Africa.

JavaScript is language that was initially designed in 10 days and shipped with a lot of quacks that we still deal with today. However, beyond these quacks it turns out that JavaScript has some very good parts and it is worth learning. \r\n\r\n - Learn about the bad parts and how to avoid them (use a tools like [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com) and [JSHint](http://jshint.com))\r\n - Use promises and control flow libraries to write better JavaScript/Node.js apps\r\n - Use JavaScript frameworks for building large apps\r\n - Use compile-to-JavaScript languages like CoffeeScript and TypeScript\r\n - JavaScript is evolving, learn about ES6 and ES7 features - use [Google Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) to start using future features today\r\n\r\n### Micro Services\r\nTech evolution is moving towards a microservices architecture.\r\n - Use the principles of the [12Factor App](http://12factor.net/) to write stateless stand alone apps that do one thing and one only.\r\n - Services maintain individual versions and should be deployed individually\r\n - Node is a perfect fit for the microservices architecture\r\n - Use something like Redis or messages queues to share state\r\n - Microservices architecture - Docker, Raik, Redis, NoSQL, nginx, e.t.c..\r\n - Benefits of micro services architecture - decentralised teams, faster deployments, easier for new team members to start contributing, supports use of multiple languages\r\n\r\n### IOLMobile\r\nThe [IOLMobile.co.za](http://iolmobile.co.za) website uses express on the back-end and Angular on the the front-end.\r\n\r\n- Stack - Express, Angular, Redis, elastic search, nginx, Cloudflare\r\n- Internal microservices - [Weather app](http://iolmobile.co.za/#!/weather), [Matric results](http://iolmobile.co.za/#!/matric), [Search](http://iolmobile.co.za/#!/search)\r\n- Faster development cycle, improved performance, faster response times\r\n- Future Plans - phasing out Java in favour of Node.js.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nEvan says that he hopes he doesn\'t have to write Java again because of the joy he has found in Node.js.

The event was hosted by Guy Bedford ([@guybeford](http://twitter.com/guybedford)), Guy Paterson-Jones ([@GuyPatJones](http://twitter.com/GuyPatJones)), and Tim Lind ([@timlind](http://twitter.com/timlind)).\r\n\r\nThe event was opened by Tim Lind who gave us an overview of the presentation and how their collaboration came about.\r\n\r\nGuy Bedford then followed up and spoke about the current state of web development, how it has moved from server-side rendering to client-side rendering. This has given rise to [Single Page Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs). The rise of SPAs has brought about its own set of challenges like degraded performance and SEO indexing. As a result, a lot of frameworks have cropped up to try and solve these problems.\r\n\r\nSome of the takeaways from Guy\'s presentation are as follows:\r\n\r\n - Web development has largely moved from server-side rendering to the client\r\n - The rise of Single Page Applications has created a need to render part of the application on the server to improve performance and SEO. A web app that uses this technique is called an Isomorphic JavaScript Application.\r\n - A good guide when choosing a framework is modularity because it promotes code re-use and is easier to maintain\r\n - React is currently the most trending framework for creating Isomorphic JavaScript Applications.\r\n - React\'s magic is in its implementation of a virtual DOM and the diffing algorithm\r\n\r\nGuy Bedford finished off his presentation by introducing Guy Paterson-Jones, who showed us the demo they had prepared. \r\n\r\nThe demo, named [zygo](https://github.com/zygo-io/zygo), is a research project  that Guy Paterson-Jones worked on while doing his internship at [jspm](http://jspm.io). The project explores an alternative way of building Isomorphic JavaScript Applications. You can learn more about the project by [checking it out on Github](https://github.com/zygo-io/zygo).\r\n\r\nThe meetup ended off with some QAs.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention goes to the Andrew Newdigate, co-founder of [gitter.im](https://gitter.im), who also attended the meetup.\r\n\r\nHope to see you at our next meetup, till then - keep hacking!\r\n','<p>On Thursday 19 March 2015 we held the 3rd NodeJS Cape Town  meetup of the year at <a href=\"http://io.co.za\">IO-Digital</a> in Woodstock.
